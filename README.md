# churn
Multiple machine learning algorithms implemented to predict whether a customer would leave or not

this project is proceeding with the following steps:

1 data analysis

    composition of data, dataset info, problem rephrasing
  
2 data cleaning

    missing values
  
3 feature engineering

    correlation and covariance between features
  
4 modeling SVM and logistic regression method

    fit the data to SVM and logistic models, hyperparameter tuning 
  
5 performance check for different models

    confusion matrix, accuracy, precision and recall
